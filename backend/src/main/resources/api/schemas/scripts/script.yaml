type: object
properties:
  header:
    type: string
    description:
      This block is prepended to all scripts (setup, parallel jobs, slurm
      configs, and cleanups) and can contain global constants/variables,
      functions, shell options, and more.
  setupScript:
    type: string
    description:
      This script is used to setup the environment for the processing.  This
      will typically include extraction of archives, creation of folders,
      etc.  This, if provided, will be ran on compute nodes.
  setupSlurmConfig:
    type: string
    description:
      Slurm configuration to use to run the setup script, not including the
      srun.
  loopWrapperTop:
    type: string
    description:
      The top of the loop used to generate jobs. This can be a block of code
      ended by a for loop, for example (including the do).  If only performing
      one job, leave this blank.
  idVariable:
    type: string
    description:
      This should be a unique variable (e.g. $subject, including the $) that can
      be used to identify jobs.  This should/will be used in job names, output
      log filenames, etc.  If there is only a single job, use any string without
      a $.
  jobTemplate:
    type: string
    description:
      This is the code that should be run in parallel on compute nodes.
  slurmTemplate:
    type: string
    description:
      This is the script that will define the Slurm configuration and queue the
      jobs generated from JOB_TEMPLATE.  This should not include the sbatch
      command, only options.
  loopWrapperBottom:
    type: string
    description:
      The bottom of the loop used to generate jobs.  This should close any loops
      started in the LOOP_WRAPPER_TOP.  If only performing one job, leave this
      blank.
  cleanupScript:
    type: string
    description:
      This script can be used to cleanup the environment after jobs have been
      completed.  This can include deleting temporary files, moving results into
      appropriate locations, etc.
  cleanupSlurmConfig:
    type: string
    description:
      Slurm configuration to use for the cleanup job, excluding the srun.
  cleanupMode:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ALL_ENDED
      - ALL_SUCCESS
      - NEVER
    description:
      "This dictates when the cleanup script should be run: if it should run
      after all jobs have ended (regardless of success), all jobs have"
