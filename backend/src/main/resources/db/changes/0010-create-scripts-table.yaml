      changes:
        - createTable:
            tableName: scripts
            remarks:
              Stores scripts used for each batch as well as scripts designed for
              multiple uses (and global templates)
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: ID
                  type: UUID
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                    primaryKey: true
                  remarks: Unique ID for the script
              - column:
                  name: USERNAME
                  type: VARCHAR(255)
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: The username of the script's creator
              - column:
                  name: NAME
                  type: TEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: A name for this script
              - column:
                  name: HEADER
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This block is prepended to all scripts (setup, parallel
                    jobs, slurm configs, and cleanups) and can contain global
                    constants/variables, functions, shell options, and more.
              - column:
                  name: SETUP_SCRIPT
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This script is used to setup the environment for the
                    processing.  This will typically include extraction of
                    archives, creation of folders, etc.  This, if provided, will
                    be ran on compute nodes.
              - column:
                  name: SETUP_SLURM_CONFIG
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    Slurm configuration to use to run the setup script, not
                    including the srun.
              - column:
                  name: LOOP_WRAPPER_TOP
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    The top of the loop used to generate jobs. This can be a
                    block of code ended by a for loop, for example (including
                    the do).  If only performing one job, leave this blank.
              - column:
                  name: ID_VAR
                  type: TINYTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This should be a unique variable (e.g. $subject, including
                    the $) that can be used to identify jobs.  This should/will
                    be used in job names, output log filenames, etc.  If there
                    is only a single job, use any string without a $.
              - column:
                  name: JOB_TEMPLATE
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This is the code that should be run in parallel on compute
                    nodes.
              - column:
                  name: SLURM_TEMPLATE
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This is the script that will define the Slurm configuration
                    and queue the jobs generated from JOB_TEMPLATE.
              - column:
                  name: LOOP_WRAPPER_BOTTOM
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    The bottom of the loop used to generate jobs.  This should
                    close any loops started in the LOOP_WRAPPER_TOP.  If only
                    performing one job, leave this blank.
              - column:
                  name: CLEANUP_SCRIPT
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    This script can be used to cleanup the environment after
                    jobs have been completed.  This can include deleting
                    temporary files, moving results into appropriate locations,
                    etc.
              - column:
                  name: CLEANUP_SLURM_CONFIG
                  type: MEDIUMTEXT
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks: Slurm configuration to use for the cleanup job.
              - column:
                  name: CLEANUP_MODE
                  type: script_cleanup_mode
                  constraints:
                    nullable: false
                  remarks:
                    "This dictates when the cleanup script should be run: if it
                    should run after all jobs have ended (regardless of
                    success), all jobs have"
              - column:
                  name: CREATED_TS
                  type: timestamp

                  constraints:

                  remarks:
                    If the script is deleted (shouldn't be shown).  Must be kept
                    for archival purposes.
