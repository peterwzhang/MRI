  summary: Update a single script
  description:
    Edit/update a new script.  This endpoint can create scripts, however, this
    is not recommended; if this endpoint is used for this purpose, the server
    will NOT guarantee that the newly-created ID will be the same as what was
    included in the request.  Any client using this endpoint to create scripts
    should keep this in mind; in the instance that a script is created rather
    than updated, a 201 is returned.
